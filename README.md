# epic-crud-template

This repository is a modified version of the Epic Stack and tracks changes to the Epic Stack as a Sly Template

## Sly Templates

All changes to the Epic stack can be pulled in via Sly, turned into patches, and applied to this repository

In turn, the Epic CRUD workshops use this repository as their Sly template, so it serves as an initial triage for features I want to propagate to the workshops.

For example, the workshops don't care about Sentry, so it has been removed from this repository. When the Epic Stack changes its Sentry config, I can ignore those changes here, and then I don't need to ignore them in every single workshop exercise.
